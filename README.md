# Artemiy Kochergin's flutter_app

Here're the comments on the project implementation.

The project tree may look quite bad, so let me clarify the structure:
- You can find all the .dart files that were written by me in the lib folder
- The application was initialized with "flutter create" command
- pubspec.yaml file is located in the root directory

Main things to metion:
App works on android.
It doesn't show pictures cause api returns 404 error.
It shows new Chuck Norris joke every time any of two buttons is pressed.
